# Project: Blog API

A blog with a back-end and two different front-ends. One for read blog posts and comments, while the other one will be just for user to write, edit and publish blog posts.

Built to practice RESTful APIs and JWT.

Issues:
1. Need improvement: Refactor authentication components with custom hook
2. To fix: Display proper error message if fetch response if not ok
3. Need improvement: Add test cases to front-end react components
4. Need improvement: Add test cases to back-end functions
